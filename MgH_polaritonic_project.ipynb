    "We will consider two quantum states for the photon - no photon in the cavity, denoted by $|0\\rangle$ with associated energy eigenvalue $0$\n",
    "and one photon in the cavity, denoted by $|1\\rangle$ with associated energy eigenvalue $\\hbar \\omega$.  Note that essentially shifts the photon Hamiltonian by the zero-point energy $\\hbar \\frac{\\omega}{2}$.\n",

    "The polaritonic potential energy surfaces may be obtained by building a Hamiltonian matrix in the following basis and diagonalizing as a function of the bond length $R$: $ |\\phi\\rangle \\in \\{|g,0\\rangle , |g,1\\rangle , |e,0\\rangle, |e,1\\rangle \\}. $\n",

    "#### Review of Dirac Bra-Ket notation\n",
    "We have used Dirac's bra-ket notation for both the electronic and the photonic states.  In this notation,\n",
    "$|n\\rangle = \\psi_n$ is known as the *ket* for state $n$, \n",
    "and $\\langle m| = \\psi_m^*$ is known as the *bra* for state $m$.  This applies\n",
    "to both electronic and photonic states, where we are specifically\n",
    "using the notation $|g\\rangle$ to denote the ground electronic ket, $|e\\rangle$ to denote\n",
    "the first-excited electronic ket, $|0\\rangle$ to denote the 0-photon ket, and $|1\\rangle$ to \n",
    "denote the 1-photon ket.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important rule in this notation is the\n",
    "following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\langle n | m \\rangle = \\int \\psi^*_n \\psi_m d\\tau = \\delta_{nm} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the Kronicker delta function $\\delta_{nm}$ is equal to 1 if $n = m$ and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "We can use this rule to compute different terms in the Hamiltonian matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Review of rules for the projection operators for electronic states\n",
    "\n",
    "The projection operators for molecular electronic states are denoted\n",
    "$|n\\rangle \\langle m|$ where again $|n\\rangle = \\psi_n$ is known as the *ket* for electronic state $n$, \n",
    "and $\\langle m |= \\psi_m^*$ is known as the *bra* for electronic state $m$. \n",
    "In this notebook, we will restrict the electronic states to the ground state (denoted $|g\\rangle$) \n",
    "and the first excited state (denoted $|e\\rangle$).  \n",
    "Let us examine the contribution that arises from the $E_g(R) |g\\rangle \\langle g|$\n",
    "term in the Hamiltonian between the basis state $|g,0\\rangle = |g\\rangle |0\\rangle$\n",
    "on the bra and the ket:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "& \\langle g|\\langle0| \\left( E_g(R) |g\\rangle \\langle g|\\right)| g\\rangle  |0\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "= & \\langle 0|0\\rangle \\langle g | \\left( E_g(R) |g\\rangle \\langle g|\\right)| g\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "=& 1 \\cdot \\langle g | E_g(R) |g\\rangle \\cdot 1 \\\\\n",
    "&= E_g(R)  \\langle g | g \\rangle \\\\\n",
    "&= E_g(R)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where we have used the fact that the projection operator $|g\\rangle \\langle g|$\n",
    "only acts on the electronic states, so we were able to factor out our photonic bra\n",
    "and kets $\\langle 0 | 0 \\rangle = 1$, and then we were also able \n",
    "to bring the ground-state energy eigenvalue $E_g(R)$ outside the integral in the second-to-last step just leaving $E_g(R) \\langle g | g \\rangle = E_g(R)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 1: Combine these rules to evaluate the following:\n",

    "\\langle e| \\left({\\bf A} \\cdot \\mu_{eg} |e\\rangle \\langle g|\\right)|g\\rangle\n",

    "\n",
    "The photonic raising operators generally obey $\\hat{b}^{\\dagger}|n\\rangle = \\sqrt{n+1}|n+1\\rangle$,\n",
    "where $n$ denotes the number of photons that occupy the cavity.  \n",
    "For the basis states in question, we have the following:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\hat{b}^{\\dagger}|0\\rangle = |1\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "\\hat{b}^{\\dagger}|1\\rangle = \\sqrt{2}|2\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $|\\rangle$ denotes a fermionic Fock vacuum state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The photonic lowering operators generally obey $\\hat{b}|n\\rangle = \\sqrt{n}|n-1\\rangle$, so for the\n",
    "basis states in question, we have:\n",

    "\\hat{b}|0\\rangle = 0.\n",
