    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine-learning (ML) is broadly defined as any algorithm which improves by feeding more data into the algorithm. Familiar concepts such as basic linear regression can be understood as applications of ML, where more data in the regression provides a better fit to a straight line which can then be used to predict new points. This is an example of **supervised** learning, where some input values (x) and output values (y) are known from the beginning. These values compose a **training set**, a defining feature of any ML method. Unsupervised learning is also possible, and is generally used for finding patterns in correlated data; however, we will restrict our discussion to supervised learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "ML has found applications across the physical sciences including (but not limited to) engineering, physics, biology, and chemistry. By utilizing training sets of molecules and their various properties, chemists can make use of ML algorithms by predicting molecular properties using only the molecular formula or structure without the need for time-consuming experiments. However, generating a robust database of reference values to train the ML model is a tedious task for experimental chemists. Computational chemistry provides a quick and consistent way to produce training data for a reference set of molecules. Once a model is trained with these reference data, properties for new molecules (or geometries of the same molecule) can be predicted at very low cost -- no experiment or electronic structure calculation required.
